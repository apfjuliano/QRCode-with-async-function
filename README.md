# QRCode-with-async-function
 A simple script to generate a QRCode and dowload it as an png image. You will be able to set the width/height, colors and the text (could be an url) to be coded. Also, we use an async function (async/await) to generate the QRCode and then we create a link to download the png image. The async funtion garantee that the link will be able to be used only when the QRCode is done.
